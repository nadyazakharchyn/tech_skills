Death, suits you dear sir
Like a beautiful coat but then without all the fur
I wonder would it fit me?
What do you think I'd prefer?
You know some people'd rather not exist
They put a gun to the heart or a knife to the wrist
We ought to think they aren't smart
It could be something I missed
Right then, she kisses my skin
I don't know what this is or where to begin
This fills me up with bliss
Don't tell me this was a dream
And she, shows me that life
Isn't all about explaining your time
No, it's the perfect time to lay all night
When time occurs - conflict
Don't make it right - conflict
Don't make me right - conflict
It's me to decide - conflict
This or that side - conflict
I need your word - conflict
Leave it aside - conflict
Just don't make me right - conflict
It's me to decide - conflict
This or that side - conflict
This or that side - conflict
This or that side - conflict
You, look at me now - conflict
With that burning cigar hanging out of your mouth - conflict
And it seems all a lie - conflict
What they've told me so far - conflict
