Death, suits you dear sir
Like a beautiful coat but then without all the fur
I wonder would it fit me?
What do you think I'd prefer?
You know some people'd rather not exist
They put a gun to the heart or a knife to the wrist
We ought to think they aren't smart
It could be something I missed
Right then, she kisses my skin
I don't know what this is or where to begin
This fills me up with bliss
Don't tell me this was a dream
And she, shows me that life
Isn't all about explaining your time
No, it's the perfect time to lay all night
When time occurs
Don't make it right
Don't make me right
It's me to decide
This or that side
I need your word
Leave it aside
Just don't make me right
It's me to decide
This or that side
This or that side
This or that side
You, look at me now
With that burning cigar hanging out of your mouth
And it seems all a lie
What they've told me so far
